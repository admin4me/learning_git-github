github is free code hosting platform. where you can even save your private or public code<br>

during code to open your terminal in vscode press ctrl+shift+~<br><br>
git --version <p>this command is used to check version of git installed in your system</p><br>
git config --global user.name "give your username in quotation" </p>this is used to configure your username in git<p><br>
